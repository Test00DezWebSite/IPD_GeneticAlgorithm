# Genetic Algorithms and The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

The focus of this project was to demonstrate how using a tailored genetic algorithm we can generate optimal strategies for the iterated prisoner's dilemma.

For more information regarding the project and it's results you can refer to the [project paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TV7nQF-XnHPHVjnoNT8iKwX7fBcU08FUxxrUriw0Xhs/edit?usp=sharing) where I go indepth on how both genetic algorithms and the iterated prisoner's dilemma works, as well as how they are tied together to form the final results.

## Dependencies

We take advantange of high level web frameworks to make the app easy to use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript library for building user interfaces
* [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - CSS bootstrap library built for react
* Many more dependencies can be found in the project's `package.json` file

## Setup

Begin by cloning the project into a local directory on your machine

```sh
$ mkdir IPD_G && cd ./IPD_G
$ git clone https://github.com/rammom/IPD_GeneticAlgorithm.git .
```

Start up the React server
```sh
$ npm install && npm start
```

Starting up the react server should directly open up a tab to the application, if not you can get to it at `http://localhost:3000`

## Results

See the [project paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TV7nQF-XnHPHVjnoNT8iKwX7fBcU08FUxxrUriw0Xhs/edit?usp=sharing) for detailed results found during development.
